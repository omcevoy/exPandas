# A Simple Analysis of Pokemon

This project was done so that I could get more comfortable working with pandas. It also helped me get familiar with visualization libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn. I got the data for this project from Kaggle, and want to give a special thank you to user [Ashwini Swain](https://www.kaggle.com/ash316), who made the notebook that I followed.
