# exPandas


This repository is the homebase for all my data analysis related projects where I use Python as my main tool.

Right now there are 2 projects posted:
* Analyzing [Pokemon](https://github.com/omcevoy/exPandas/tree/master/pokemon) using Pandas, Matplotlib, & Seaborn
  * In this project I look into the stats of each Pokemon, determine the most powerful type(s) for generation 1, and analyze just how powerful legendary pokemon are
  
* Analyzing [Roller Coasters](https://github.com/omcevoy/exPandas/tree/master/rollercoaster) using Pandas & Matplotlib
  * In this project I created 6 functions that simply visualized the 3 datasets in different & unique ways
