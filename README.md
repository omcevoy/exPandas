# exPandas


### 8/3/2020
This repository was initially created so I'd have a place to store all of my practice work with Pandas, but has become more of the homebase for all my data analysis related projects. At the moment it includes projects I am completing off of Kaggle and Codecademy, although I hope to start adding EDA projects soon. 


Right now there are 2 projects posted:
* An analysis of [Pokemon](https://github.com/omcevoy/exPandas/tree/master/pokemon)
** In this project I look into the stats of each Pokemon, determine the most powerful type(s) for generation 1, and analyze just how powerful legendary pokemon are
